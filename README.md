# Time-Series-Forecasting-on-U.S.-Economic-Indicators-
This research focuses on time series
forecasting for four key financial assets: SP-500, EUR-USD,
Gold, and Crude Oil. Time series forecasting creates models
from past data and applies them to predict what will be
observed in the future. The intention is to provide future-oriented
insights to support strategic decision-making. Three essential
elements involved in time series analysis are seasonality (regular
patterns), cyclical fluctuations, and trend (consistent movement).
Nonetheless, while making judgments based on projections, it’s
critical to take uncertainty and other influences into account. We
used three Uni-variate forecasting models: Simple Exponential
Smoothing, Moving Average, ARIMA; and 2 Multivariate mod-
els: SARIMAX, and XGBoost. While we used several accuracy
metrics, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the main
performance metric. The results indicate that Simple Exponential
Smoothing outperformed the other models with an RMSE of
0.16, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the underlying
patterns in the data. Following it is the Moving average, with
an RMSE of 0.84. On the other hand, ARIMA, SARIMAX,
and XGBOOST scored a higher RMSE of 1.66, 1.89, and 1.53
respectively. These results suggest lower forecasting accuracy and
performance for more complex models with more features and
capabilities.
